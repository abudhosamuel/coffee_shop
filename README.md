# Coffee Shop Domain Model

Coffee Shop Domain Model
The Coffee Shop Domain Model is a Python application that simulates the core operations of a coffee shop using object-oriented principles. It models the relationships between key entities like Customer, Coffee, and Order. The system is designed to handle multiple customers placing orders, track each coffee's popularity, and identify the customer who spends the most on a particular coffee (known as the "aficionado").

This project demonstrates:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
Relationships between entities (Customer, Order, and Coffee).
Validation of inputs such as customer names, coffee names, prices, and order quantities.
Aggregation and association methods to calculate statistics (e.g., average coffee price, number of orders).
